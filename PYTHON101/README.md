# Getting started with Python programming language

In this workshop weâ€™ll go through the basic semantics of Python programming language. We will go through:
- the `datatypes` for variables
- variable assignment and usage
- logical branching using `if-else` statement
- data structures likes `lists` and `tuples`
- the `while loop` and `for loop`
- the `modules` and we will place a REST API call using the `requests` module to fetch response and access the values accordingly

You can refer to [API101](../API101/README.md) to understand the basics of REST API.

# Prerequisites
