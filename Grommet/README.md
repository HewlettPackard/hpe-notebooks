# Streamline app development with open source Grommet and Grommet Designer

This workshop focuses on how developers/designers can use Grommet and Grommet Designer, to quickly design/develop their web applications, generate the code from the design, push the source code to GitHub and deploy it on netlify.

We’ll start off by introducing Grommet and cover some fundamentals about designing a web application using Grommet Designer, using your Bio as an example. We’ll walk you through the process, step by step.
