    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook will drive you through the following steps :\n",
    "\n",
    "- Design your app using [Grommet Designer](https://designer.grommet.io/)\n",
    "- Publish your design\n",
    "- Share your design for feedback\n",
    "- Generate code from the design\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be designing your **Bio application**, which may look like the sample below:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## You are student$$I\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start designing a personal web app to host your biography. You can either follow the instructions below step-by-step or you can modify some of the steps to create your own design.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: If you have any difficulty in designing your app by following the steps below, you can directly download the source code from [here](https://github.com/reddypramod85/studentxx) and proceed to the [Lab 3](3-WKSHP-PrepareEnvironment.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "First, open a browser on your laptop, preferably Chrome, and open the [Grommet Designer](https://designer.grommet.io/) site to start designing your app.\n",

    "## How to add a component and edit its properties\n",
    "\n",
    "Before proceeding further, let's take a look at how to add a component and edit its properties on the Grommet designer site.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the left sidebar, click on the **+** icon to add a new **Box** component.\n",
    "\n",
    "![ClickPlus.png](Pictures/ClickPlus.png)\n",

    "![editDeleteComponent.png](Pictures/editDeleteComponent.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**\n",
    "\n",
    "- To ignore the property value, simply mark its value as **undefined**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can find the **code** , **new design from this**, **reset**, **help**,  **duplicate**, and **delete** options for each component in the top right corner, as shown below.\n",

    "## Step 0 - Import Existing Designs\n",
    "\n",
    "To import existing design components into your design, click on your design name **student$$I** on the top left of your screen. Then click on **configure**.\n",
    "\n",
    "![import.PNG](Pictures/import.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Click on the **+** icon next to the Imports section and add the URL of the design you want to import.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, Let's import the HPE Design System components by adding its URL https://designer.grommet.io/home?id=HPE-design-system-hpedesignsystem-hpe-com and existing Bio Card design by adding its URL https://designer.grommet.io/undefined?id=Card-pramod-reddy-sareddy-hpe-com and close the popup screen.\n",

    "## Step 1 - Create a Header\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a header by adding the **Avatar Header** component available under HPE design system.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, select the existing **Box** component in the left sidebar and click on the **+** icon. Search for **Avatar Header** and add it.\n",

    "\n",
    "You have successfully designed your header!!!!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2 - Design your Card\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have finished creating the header, let's add a bio card.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your bio card may consist of your picture, name, role, biography, and links to your portfolio, etc.\n",

    "You can modify the Avatar by selecting the **Avatar** box component under **card** section and edit its image URL under **background** section on the right side bar as shown below \n",
    "\n",
    "![avatar.png](Pictures/avatar.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, you can modify your name, Role, Description, links for Portfolio, Hite ME, etc\n",

    "Now that we have finished creating the card, let's add a **footer**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Select the **Box** component in the left sidebar and click on the **+** icon. Search for the **Footer** component under HPE design system and click select to add it.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Now, you can edit the properties of the **Footer** component to suit your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add/Modify/Delete Copyright message, terms, privacy, security, and feedback links.\n",
    "\n",
    "![edit-footer.png](Pictures/edit-footer.png)\n",

    "### Change Theme\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have finished designing your app, let's take a look at how to apply a **theme** or change to a different one.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the Grommet theme will be selected in the HPE Grommet Designer, so you will see all your buttons, links etc. in a violet color. To select a different theme, first click on your design name **student$$I**. Click on **Configure** and then click on the URL under the **Theme** section. Change it to your desired theme(hpe-next, for example) and close the pop up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you can see that the button colors have changed from violet(Grommet theme) to green, as per your theme selection (HPE).\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theme Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "Grommet also offers you a couple of theme modes; **light** and **dark**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't want to view your app with too much brightness, select the dark mode and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Click on your design name **student$$I**, Configure and select the theme mode as either light or dark to see the difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Light\n",
    "- Dark\n",

    "![thememode.png](Pictures/thememode.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "![darkmode.png](Pictures/darkmode.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Publish, Download or Generate Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Turn your design into a real code that you can use to create a live site.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you finish designing your app, you can either Publish, Download, or Generate the code by clicking on the **share** icon as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![share.png](Pictures/share.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "![share2.png](Pictures/share2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "First, click on **Publish** option to publish your design in grommet Designer by providing your email and a 3 digit pin. You can share the publish URL with others to share your design and get feedback. You can see my design [here.](https://designer.grommet.io/?id=StudentXX-pramod-reddy-sareddy-hpe-com)\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, click on **Generate code** option to generate the code.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Congratulations\n",
    "\n",
    "You have successfully designed your app using [Grommet Designer](https://designer.grommet.io/). Please proceed to [Lab 3](3-WKSHP-PrepareEnvironment.ipynb) notebook to prepare your workstation to run the application locally.\n",
