    "This Jupyter notebook will drive you through the following steps :\n",
    "\n",
    "- Install nodejs, npm, and npx\n",
    "- Install yarn\n",
    "- Create a react app\n",
    "- Adding grommet\n",
    "- Add generated code from grommet designer\n",
    "- Run the application\n",
    "- Push the code to GitHub repo\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial assumes that you don't have node.js and a package manager; either npm (npm is installed with node.js) or yarn package manager. Create react app can be installed globally or locally using npx (npx comes with npm 5.2+).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install nodejs, npm, and npx\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Node Download Page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - The latest LTS version will have node.js, npm, and npx.\n",
