    "In this tutorial, we have shown you how **tenant users** can deploy, programmatically, cloud native stateless, microservices applications, and non-cloud native distributed stateful AI/analytics KubeDirector applications on Kubernetes clusters managed by the HPE Ezmeral Container Platform. You also used the standard Kubernetes command line (kubectl) to interact with the Kubernetes cluster in the context of your tenant user account. \n",
