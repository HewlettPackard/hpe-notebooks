    "### Introduction to HPE SimpliVity Workshop<nt>\n",
    "In this workshop you will go through basic implementation scenario using SimpliVity REST API with a couple of scripting languages such as PowerShell and Python. Additionally, you will also explore the SimpliVity's Ansible module to create desired state configuration for your infrastructure automation<br>\n",
    "### Lab Flow <nt>\n",
    "These HackShack Workshops are delivered through a central point that allows a portable, dynamic version of the lab guides. We are now leveraging a JupyterHub server on which all the different labs guides will be stored in a Notebook format (*.ipynb). Notebooks are accessible from the internet for the event.<br>\n",
    "The notebooks can be downloaded on to your own laptop for further usage or editing. In order to use  them, you will need to install the Jupyter Notebook application available [here](https://jupyter.org/install).<br>\n",
    "A Beginner's Guide is also available [here](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html)<br>\n",
    "Please listen now to the instructor guidelines on how to use this notebook and follow along as the different steps are covered<br>\n",
    "Enjoy the labs ! :-)<br>\n",
