-	Fork the repo then clone your copy to:
    -	Add a folder for your stuff
    -	Add a README.md that follows the same model as the one provided in other folders (API101 for example). Explain what the notebook is about, its dependencies if any.
    -	Add a LICENSE.md file similar to the API101 for example
    -	Add your notebook(s), make sure the link from your README works. You might need to do a little cleanup from Discover as we donâ€™t need the intro/outro notebooks
    -   Make sure your notebook was saved with the output from the code cells
    -	Add the pictures from your notebooks in a folder Pictures
    -	Finally edit the README.md file at the root of the repo to add your contribution to the list. 
-	Then submit a Pull Request to the repo.

We will do our best to review and respond as quickly as possible.
