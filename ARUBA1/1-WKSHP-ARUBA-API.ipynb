This is good for a single machine but the script will fail if shared and run on a computer that doesn't have the environment variables set correctly.\n",

Essentially this is like setting the environment variables, and sufferes from the same problem of needing to be set on every machine for the code to run. See https://pypi.org/project/keyring/ for more details.\n",
    "3. *Input secret on execution* - This is the most user-friendly way to approach secrets for the beginner. A function is added to the code instead for the actual password, and when the script is run, the code asks the user for the password, which they then enter. Simple and portable, with all the normal problems associated with passwords, but at least you're not including such sensitive information in your scripts.  \n",

    "1. We set a value of False for the object non-compliance. This Python object is called a boolean, we can use it to track a state of True or False, a bit like a light-switch, either on or off. At the start, before the loop we set the non_compliance switch to False: `non_compliance = False`\n",
    "2. We run through the login, GET the hostname and firmware.\n",
    "3. We then run an 'if' check against the string returned in the \"current_version\".\n",
    "4. If the firmware doesn't match the conservative_release we flip the switch on \"non_compliance\" and print out the details.\n",
    "5. We then log out and go through the loop again. Note that \"non-compliance\" is set to False outside of the loop, so this is not reset. If we see non-compliance once in the whole process, it is always set True.\n",
    "6. Finally we do a check against non_compliance, and if it has not been set to True, we print out a line to declare this. That's a cleaner way to finish than just leaving a blank page.\n"
